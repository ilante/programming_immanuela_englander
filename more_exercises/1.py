# 1) Write a function that multiplies two N*N matrices.
# As a test you can use:

A = [[2,4],[3,1]]

B = [[2,1],[1,3]]
print(len(A))
print(len(A[0]))

# the result of which is:

# AB = [[8, 14][7, 6]] 

# def matrix_multiplication(A, B):
# 	multi_matrix=[]
# 	sublist=[]
# 	if ‘A’:
# 		for i in len(:
